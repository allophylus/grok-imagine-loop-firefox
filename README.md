# Grok Imagine Loop Extension

A Firefox Utility Extension to automate video generation loops on [Grok.com](https://grok.com).

This tool allows you to create seamless video sequences by automatically using the last frame of a generated video as the input for the next generation, creating a continuous "flow" effect.

## Recent Updates (Release Notes)

**v1.6.5 (Hotfixes)**
*   **🛠️ Upscale Reliability:** Fixed an issue where the extension failed to find the Upscale button due to Grok UI changes. It now precisely targets the new "Video Settings" SVG menu and ignores history items.
*   **🚀 Performance Boost:** Added an 800ms debounce buffer when typing in individual Scene Prompts to completely eliminate popup UI freezing/sluggishness.
*   **💥 Crash Fix:** Resolved the `Message exceeded maximum allowed size of 64MiB` crash. The extension no longer attempts to send massive Base64 image strings across the browser IPC bridge when clicking "Start Generation", and instead reads them directly from local storage.

## Features

*   **🔄 Auto-Looping (Scenes):** Automatically chains video generations. Define how many "Scenes" you want for your story.
*   **🖼️ Smart Frame Extraction:** Extracts the last frame of a video to use as the start of the next one.
- **Global Suffix:** Define a shared style prompt (e.g., "photorealistic") that is automatically appended to every scene.
- **Pause After Video:** Optional "Step Mode" to pause the loop after each generation, allowing for manual review and adjustments.
*   **⚡ Upscale Support:** Check "Upscale Result" to automatically request the High Quality version of each video.
*   **📥 Auto-Download:** Automatically saves each generated segment to your Downloads folder.
*   **🏷️ Custom Filename Prefix:** Set a custom text string to prepend to all auto-downloaded video filenames.
*   **💾 State Persistence:**
    *   **Input Saving:** Your Prompts, Scene counts, and settings are saved automatically.
    *   **Config Presets:** Save and load multiple "Loops" (Settings + Scenes) for easy reuse.
*   **⇱ Side Panel Workflow:**
    *   **Native Integration:** Runs directly in the Firefox Sidebar for a seamless experience.
    *   **Optional Dashboard:** Toggle the floating on-page overlay if you prefer a clean view.
*   **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Fully native support for all Grok interface languages via intelligent translation mapping (no hardcoded English).
*   **🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection:** 
    *   **Fast Human-Like Input:** Randomized timing but optimized for speed (Paste-like insertion).
    *   **Randomized Delays:** Unpredictable wait times to mimic human behavior.
*   **🧪 A/B Test Handling:** Automatically detects and skips the "Which video do you prefer?" survey popup in all supported languages.
*   **⚙️ Advanced Settings:**
    *   **Strict Mode:** Force "Enter Key" submission if button clicks are inconsistent.
    *   **Skip on Moderation:** Option to automatically skip prompts that trigger content flags instead of pausing.
*   **🛠️ Full Control:** 
    *   **Regenerate:** Retry any specific segment directly from the list.
    *   **Resume with Edits:** Edit future prompts while paused, then resume to apply changes dynamically.
    *   **Global Suffix:** Apply a common style or instruction to *every* scene automatically (e.g. "cinematic lighting").

## Performance & Troubleshooting

### Loop Pausing / Slowing Down in Background
If the extension stops or runs very slowly when you switch tabs, you are hitting **Chrome's Background Tab Throttling**. This is a browser feature to save battery.

**Solutions:**
1.  **Keep the Tab Visible:** Drag the Grok tab into its own separate window so it remains "visible" on your screen, even if behind other windows.
2.  **Configure Throttling:** Chrome has made it harder to disable this completely. See this discussion for current workarounds: [Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1isgt0s/did_google_remove_the_ability_to_turn_off_tab/).
