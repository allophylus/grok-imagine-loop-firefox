# Grok Imagine Loop Extension

A Chrome Utility Extension to automate video generation loops on [Grok.com](https://grok.com).

This tool allows you to create seamless video sequences by automatically using the last frame of a generated video as the input for the next generation, creating a continuous "flow" effect.

## Features

*   **🔄 Auto-Looping (Scenes):** Automatically chains video generations. Define how many "Scenes" you want for your story.
*   **🖼️ Smart Frame Extraction:** Extracts the last frame of a video to use as the start of the next one.
- **Global Suffix:** Define a shared style prompt (e.g., "photorealistic") that is automatically appended to every scene.
- **Pause After Video:** Optional "Step Mode" to pause the loop after each generation, allowing for manual review and adjustments.
*   **⚡ Upscale Support:** Check "Upscale Result" to automatically request the High Quality version of each video.
*   **📥 Auto-Download:** Automatically saves each generated segment to your Downloads folder.
*   **💾 State Persistence:**
    *   **Input Saving:** Your Prompts, Scene counts, and settings are saved automatically.
    *   **Config Presets:** Save and load multiple "Loops" (Settings + Scenes) for easy reuse.
*   **⇱ Side Panel Workflow:**
    *   **Native Integration:** Runs directly in the Chrome Side Panel for a seamless experience.
    *   **Optional Dashboard:** Toggle the floating on-page overlay if you prefer a clean view.
*   **🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection:** 
    *   **Fast Human-Like Input:** Randomized timing but optimized for speed (Paste-like insertion).
    *   **Randomized Delays:** Unpredictable wait times to mimic human behavior.
*   **⚙️ Advanced Settings:**
    *   **Strict Mode:** Force "Enter Key" submission if button clicks are inconsistent.
    *   **Skip on Moderation:** Option to automatically skip prompts that trigger content flags instead of pausing.
*   **🛠️ Full Control:** 
    *   **Regenerate:** Retry any specific segment directly from the list.
    *   **Resume with Edits:** Edit future prompts while paused, then resume to apply changes dynamically.
    *   **Global Suffix:** Apply a common style or instruction to *every* scene automatically (e.g. "cinematic lighting").
